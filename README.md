# Library Management System

A complete full-stack Library Management System built with **FastAPI**, **SQLite**, **SQLAlchemy**, **React**, **Vite**, and **Axios**. Includes CRUD operations, filtering, statistics, and a fully interactive UI.

---

## Features

### Backend – FastAPI
- CRUD for Books, Authors, and Categories
- Filtering by author, category, year, and limit
- Statistics endpoints (total books, average year, author range, book counts, and more)
- SQLite database via SQLAlchemy ORM

### Frontend – React (Vite)
- Modern, clean UI
- Pages for Authors, Books, and Categories
- Add / Edit / Delete via popup modals
- Book count per author
- Prevents deleting authors who have books
- Statistics displayed inside author detail view
- Axios API wrapper
