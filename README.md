## Authentication (Required for All Endpoints)

This project implements Basic Authentication using middleware.

In every API request (Thunder Client / Postman):

**Use:**
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `password123`

If credentials are missing or wrong, response will be:
```json
{
  "detail": "Unauthorized"
}
```
